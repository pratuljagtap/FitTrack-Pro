# 🏋️‍♂️ Fitness Tracker — Setup & Installation Guide

Welcome! Follow these simple steps to set up the **Fitness Tracker** React application with routing, animations, icons, charts, and beautiful responsive styling powered by **Tailwind CSS**.

> ✅ This guide assumes you have **Node.js** (v16+) and **npm** installed on your machine.  
> 💡 Not sure? Run `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal to check.

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Create the React App

We’ll use `create-react-app` to scaffold a new React project named `fitness-tracker`.

```bash
npx create-react-app fitness-tracker
```

> 💡 `npx` ensures you’re using the latest version of Create React App without installing it globally.

---

## 📁 Step 2: Navigate into the Project Folder

```bash
cd fitness-tracker
```

All subsequent commands should be run from inside this directory.

---

## 📦 Step 3: Install Required Dependencies

Install the libraries we need for routing, animations, icons, date utilities, and data visualization:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom framer-motion lucide-react date-fns recharts
```

### What each package does:
- **`react-router-dom`** → Enables navigation between pages (Dashboard, Workouts, Goals, etc.)
- **`framer-motion`** → Adds smooth animations and transitions
- **`lucide-react`** → Provides beautiful, lightweight icons (like calendar, barbell, chart, etc.)
- **`date-fns`** → Handles date formatting and manipulation (e.g., “3 days ago”, “next Monday”)
- **`recharts`** → Renders beautiful, responsive charts for progress analytics

---

## 🎨 Step 4: Install & Configure Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS lets us style the app quickly with utility classes. Run:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss autoprefixer postcss
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

This:
- Installs Tailwind and its dependencies as **devDependencies** (`-D`)
- Generates `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` config files
- Sets up PostCSS for processing Tailwind classes

> ✅ You’re now ready to use Tailwind classes like `bg-blue-500`, `p-4`, `flex`, etc.

---

## 📄 Step 5: Replace Generated Files with Your Custom Versions

⚠️ **Important**: The default files created by `create-react-app` need to be replaced with your provided project structure (the one with `Dashboard.js`, `WorkoutCard.js`, `App.js`, etc.).

➡️ **Manually replace** all files and folders inside `src/` and the root (like `tailwind.config.js`, `package.json`, etc.) with your custom versions.

📁 Your final structure should look like this:
```
fitness-tracker/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── entities/
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── index.js
│   └── ...
├── tailwind.config.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

> 💡 Tip: You can delete the original `src/App.js`, `src/App.css`, `src/logo.svg`, etc., and paste your versions in their place.

---

## ▶️ Step 6: Start the Development Server

Once all files are in place, start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

Your browser should automatically open `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## ✅ Expected Outcome

✔️ The app loads without import or module errors  
✔️ Navigation between Dashboard, Workouts, Exercises, Goals, and Progress works  
✔️ Mock data from `entities/all.js` is displayed correctly  
✔️ UI is fully responsive and styled with Tailwind  
✔️ Charts, icons, and animations function as designed

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Tips

- If you see “Module not found” errors → Double-check filenames and import paths (case-sensitive!)
- If styles aren’t loading → Ensure `index.css` imports Tailwind directives (`@tailwind base;` etc.)
- If routing doesn’t work → Confirm `App.js` wraps everything in `<BrowserRouter>` and uses `<Routes>` + `<Route>`

---

## 🎉 You’re All Set!

You now have a fully functional, modern React fitness tracking app — ready for customization, extension, or deployment.

Happy coding — and happy gains! 💪📈
